; You have to provide the types of works used here. Work types are identified by
; their query name (hyphenated name, with no special characters, used as key
; word for querying).
;
; The syntax is a bit exotic, so let's explain. The query name is followed by a
; dot and a key word (.name or .icon_name) in order to define all attributes of
; the work type:
; exampleWorkType.name: for the displayed name of the work type;
; exampleWorkType.icon_name: for the icon name of the work type, choosen in the
; FontAwesome font.
