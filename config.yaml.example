# You have to provide the tags used here. Tags are identified by their name (it
# will be converted to upper case, it should be just one word). You can provide
# a color hue (positive integer in the range [0-360]).
#
# For each tag use the following example:
#  - name: example-tag
#    color_hue: 162
tags:
  - name: example-tag
    color_hue: 162

# You have to provide the types of works used here. Work types are identified by
# their query name (hyphenated name, with no special characters, used as key
# word for querying). You can provide a work type display name (singular and
# plural) and a icon name (which is choosen among the
# [FontAwesome](http://fontawesome.io/icons/) font glyphes).
#
# For each line, use the following example:
#  - query_name: example-work-type
#    name: Example Work Type
#    name_plural: Example Work Types
#    icon_name: smile-o
worktypes:
  - query_name: example-work-type
    name: Example Work Type
    name_plural: Example Work Types
    icon_name: smile-o
