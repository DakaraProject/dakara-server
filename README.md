# Dakara server

Server for the Dakara project.

### Installation

To install Dakara completely, you have to get all the parts of the project.
Installation guidelines are provided over here:

* [Dakara web client](https://github.com/Nadeflore/dakara-client-web/);
* [Dakara player VLC](https://github.com/Nadeflore/dakara-player-vlc/).

#### System requirements

* Python3, to make everything up and running;
* [ffmpeg](https://www.ffmpeg.org/), to extract metadata from files (preferred way);
* [MediaInfo](https://mediaarea.net/fr/MediaInfo/), to extract metadata from files (slower, alternative way, may not work on Windows).

#### Virtual environment

It is strongly recommended to run the Dakara server in a virtual environment.

#### Python dependencies

Install dependencies, at the root level of the repo (in the virtual environment):

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### Setting up the server and feeding the database

Let's create the server database, after loading the virtual environment, do:

```
dakara_server/manage.py migrate
```

You should be asked to create a super user. Do it. Otherwise:

```
dakara_server/manage.py createsuperuser
```

Now, duplicate `config.yaml.example` to `config.yaml`.
You'll set up here the different tags and type of works (anime, gamesâ€¦) of your kara library.
When you're done, tell the server:

```sh
dakara_server/manage.py createtags ./config.yaml # for tags
dakara_server/manage.py createworktypes ./config.yaml # for work types
```

It's time to feed the hungry database with your kara library!
Suppose you have a anime songs folder and a Jpop songs folder in a parent kara folder:

```
kara
|-- anime
`-- jpop
```

You simply feed the database this way:

```sh
dakara_server/manage.py feed path/to/kara/anime
dakara_server/manage.py feed path/to/kara/jpop
```

All imported files will have a path relative to the kara folder.

This may take some time, depending of your collection.
You'll need `ffprobe`, provided by Ffmpeg, for this process to extract files duration (which is slow).
Pass the `-h` parameter to get some help and all the options of the feeder.

Build and link the dist folder from the [client](https://github.com/Nadeflore/dakara-client-web) to `dakara_server/static`.

Setup the [player](https://github.com/Nadeflore/dakara-player-vlc/) accordingly.

### Start the server

You're almost done! To start the server app, in the right virtual environment, do:

```
dakara_server/manage.py runserver
```

Don't forget to start the player as well.

Now, just grab some friends and have fun!
